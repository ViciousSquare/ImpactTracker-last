I need help refining my impact tracking platform based on user feedback. Please make the following specific changes to improve the user experience:

## CHANGE 1: Update Leaderboard to Impactboard
- Replace all instances of "leaderboard" with "impactboard" throughout the application
- In the "by sector" impactboard section on the front page:
  - REMOVE the "rank" column completely from the visual display
  - Keep the Impact IQ score column and maintain it as the primary metric
  - Organize/sort companies by their Impact IQ score (highest to lowest) but don't show explicit rank numbers
  - The positioning itself will indicate the ranking based on Impact IQ score

IMPORTANT: Make sure the Impact IQ score column remains visible and functional - I only want to remove the separate "rank" column, not the Impact IQ scoring system.

## CHANGE 2: Simplify Trust Section
On the front page, in the section that currently says "Trusted by leading Canadian organizations" with three listed companies:
- Remove the three company listings completely
- Replace with a simple text block that just says "Trusted by leading Canadian Organizations"
- No company names, logos, or specific references - just the header text

## CHANGE 3: Update/Remove Year Reference
Find the text that says "Preview • Basic Impacts Platform 2024" (located above the "Discover Real Impact" headline):
- Either update "2024" to "2025"
- OR remove the year entirely (e.g., "Preview • Basic Impacts Platform")
- Use your best judgment on which approach looks cleaner

## CONTEXT:
This is a social impact tracking platform for Canadian organizations. The goal is to make it less competitive-sounding (hence removing "rank" and "leaderboard") while maintaining the Impact IQ scoring system as the primary way to showcase organizational impact.

Please implement these changes carefully, ensuring that:
1. The Impact IQ functionality remains intact
2. The sorting by Impact IQ score still works properly in the impactboard
3. The overall design and user experience remains clean and professional

Let me know if you need clarification on any of these changes or if you encounter any issues during implementation.
